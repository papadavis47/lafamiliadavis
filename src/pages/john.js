              John Davis is a software engineer focused on JavaScript and Python. His primary
              interest is React.js - along with Next.js, Gatsby, and the rest of the React
              ecosystem. His favorite backend technologies are Express, Django and Flask. He is also
              interested in all things JAMStack.
            </p>
            <p>The main love in his life is his family.</p>

              He uses this website as a place to experiment with Gatsby. These pages are his sandbox
              - and they will be constantly changing. He wanted the content of the site to revolve
              around what inspires him more than anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the beginning he wanted this small space on the internet to be a place for
              experimentation and fun.
