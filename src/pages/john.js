              John Davis is a software engineer focused on front end web development technologies.
              His main focus is React.js - along with Next.js and Gatsby.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main love in his life is his family - a wife and three kids. He is using this
              website as a place to experiment with Gatsby.
            </p>
            <p>
              This website is his sandbox - constantly changing. He wanted the content of the site
              to revolve around what inspires him more than anything else.
            </p>
            <p>His beautiful family.</p>
            <p>
              In addition to be an alternative to social media for his family, from the beginning he
              wanted this site to be a place for experimentation and fun as a web developer.
