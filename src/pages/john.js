            <p>John William Davis is a software engineer focused on frontend web technologies.</p>
            <p>
              His primary interest is building user interfaces with React - including with Next.js
              and Gatsby ❤️
            </p>

            <p>
              His other interests in programming include Python, MongoDB, ethical hacking/CTF
              competions, and all things JAMStack. His favorite backend technologies are Express,
              Django and Flask.
            </p>
            <p>The main love in his life is his family.</p>
            <p>
              He uses this website as a place to experiment with Gatsby. These pages are his sandbox
              - and they will be constantly changing.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the beginning he wanted this small space on the internet to be a place for
              experimentation and fun.
            </p>
            <p>He is experimenting every week 💯</p>
            <p>
              So <strong>Stay Tuned</strong> 😎
